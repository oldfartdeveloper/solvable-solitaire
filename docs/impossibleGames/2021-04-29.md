# April 29, 2021 Game

Here is the progression of a game that I can't solve:

![Impossible Game](/docs/imgs/impossibleGames/2021-04-29.png)

The three unknown cards are:

* JD
* 10C
* 5H

The cards in the **waste** are (at this point)

* 5S, 9D, 6S
* 7D, 10D, 9C
* JD, 8D

The **foundation** shows 4C, 6H, AD, 3S

The **tableau**:

```text
2H  QH  9S  ?   ?   5D  6H
    3S  JS  7S  ?   3D  KC
        QS  7C  8S  2C  10H
            KS  4H  4C  QD
                9H  6D  AH
                    KH  8C
                        AC
```

The cards in the **waste** at the beginning are:

* AD, 5C JH
* 10S, 2S, 3C
* 5S, 9D, 7H
* 6C, 6S, 7D
* 5H, 10D, 4S
* 9C, JD, 4D
* 8D, QC, AS
* 3H, 8H, KD

Here's the initial screen:
