# Example of Possibly Impossible Game

Here is the progression of a game that I can't solve:

![Impossible Game](/docs/imgs/impossibleGames/2021-04-25.png)

Here are the cards in the waste, in order:

* 2S - blocked by QC below
* QC - blocked by 3S below
* 3S - blocked by unavailable column (active 7S) which needs 6D
* 6D - blocked by 3H below (I actually was able, in one of my tries, to place this, but lost something else).
* 3H - blocked by tableau column 3D (already occupied) and column 8S (blocked from growing from available red 7 target).  Also blocked by 4C below.
* 4C - no tableau target available: 5H already occupies one column; 8S not able receive red 7.
* 5D - blocked by 4H below
* 4H - no tableau target (3C already has 4D), and blocked by 6D above.

I found I could reduce this somewhat more but it didn't make a difference.

## Challenges

Following cards still unavailable in tableau:

* Both 7H and 7D.  These block move the 6C and 6S.
* KH.  This prevents the JH from be moved.  There is QC in the waste but it needs the KH as well.
* 2D and 2C.  These preclude buildling out the **diamond** and **club** foundations.
* QS. Don't know if critical; prevents building out KH in tableau, but would likely surface together.

Followings card unavailable in waste:

* 2S.  This precludes building the **spade** foundation.  It is blocked by the QC which can't be played.

Hence, the foundation cannot be grown from the tableau because only one column is not blocked.

## Is there an Algorithm?

There is an algorithm somewhere here that identifies the combinational effect of these blocks.  I tried several approaches here and always ended up in this problem.  Can I prove this is an unsolveable hand?

### Possible Approaches:

Verify that hidden cards "protect" each other:

* The two red 7's, if in same columns as black 6's, are a known blocker.
* KH keeps QC in waste from being moved, so this blocks JS from being moved.  
* So, if each of the above 3 cards are spread out evenly in the 3 blocked tableau columns,
  then this game is unsolveable.
 
A useful algorithm might be:

1. At the start of the game

    ```text
        For each tableau column that has hidden cards
          For each card in the column, starting at the bottom
            If the card has a direct parent above it
              and if the there is another column with the card's partner also the same ancestor's 
              partner above it, then the game is unsolveable.
    ```

    This is a [known cause of a blocked game](/docs/unsolveables.md).

1. *TODO:* Add a 3rd column with its own blockage to the above.  Now (hypothesis) the blocking cards can be in any of the 3 columns (but must be one card per column).  That is the situation we have in this example: the KH is needed for the waste QC to be played in order for the JH to be played.  We need to identify precisely that a card in the waste cannot be moved if its target is blocked by a descendent.
