# Example of Possibly Impossible Game

Here is the progression of a game that I can't solve:

![Impossible Game](/docs/imgs/impossibleGames/2021-04-25.png)

Here are the cards in the waste, in order:

* 2S
* QC
* 3S
* 6D
* 3H
* 4C
* 5D
* 4H

I found I could reduce this somewhat more.

## Challenges

Following cards still unavailable in tableau:

* Both 7H and 7D.  These block move the 6C and 6S.
* KH.  This prevents the JH from be moved.  There is QC in the waste but it needs the KH as well.
* 2D and 2C.  These preclude buildling out the **diamond** and **club** foundations.

Followings card unavailable in waste:

* 2S.  This precludes building the **spade** foundation.  It is blocked by the QC which can't be played.

Hence, the foundation cannot be grown from the tableau because only one column is not blocked.

## Summary

There is an algorithm somewhere here that identifies the combinational effect of these blocks.  I tried several approaches here and always ended up in this problem.  Can I prove this is an unsolveable hand?
