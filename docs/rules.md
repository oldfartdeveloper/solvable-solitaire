# Rules

Read the **[Rules section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)#Rules)** in the **[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire))**.  The wiki rules are modified as follows:

1. The player turns three cards at once to the **[waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_patience_terms)**, with no limit on passes through the **[deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck)**.

1. The rules of *Thoughtful Solitaire* as described in the **[Probability of winning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)#Probability_of_winning)** section are implemented by allowing unlimited use of undos.

1. The program scores by counting the number of moves, including undos, required to solve the game.  The program *guarantees* that the player can make meaningful moves to complete the game.  

    > Note that this guarantee is a large part of the development of this program.

1. The player with the least number of moves required to finish wins.  The moves count includes undos.
